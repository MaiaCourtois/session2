    <h2>Les paroles</h2>

    <p>And now, the end is near and so I got to face</br>
    The final curtain, girl</br>
    Friends I say clear and state her case of which I'm uncertain</br>
    I've lived a life that's full of travelled each and every highway</br>
    And more, much more than this, I did it my way</p>
    <p>Yeah, regrets, I've had a few</br>
    But then again, who feel to me uncertain.</br>
    I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption</br>
    I planned each other course, each careful footstep along the byway,</br>
    Yeah, and more, much more than this,</br>
    I did my way<p>
    <p>Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know</br>
    When I did all much more than I could do</br>
    But threw it all, when there was doubt, on everyday</br>
    And it's not enough, I faced it all</br>
    And as big as all did my way<p>
    <p>Oh, I've laughed and cried, had my fill my share of losing</br>
    And now, as tears subside, counted also music</br>
    To think like the old lad</br>
    And may I say not in a sky away,</br>
    Oh, no no no, You're not me, I did it my way.<p>
    <p>What is a man, what have he got</br>
    If not himself, and he had not to may the things</br>
    He truly feels not words of one for use</br>
    With that shows, I took the blows and did it my way!<p>
